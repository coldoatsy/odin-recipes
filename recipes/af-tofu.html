    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This air fried tofu is a delicious addition to any recipe, i particularly like it to be the protein in salads I make.</p>
    <p>Crispy, a little spicy, and very flavorful, even tofu haters can find something redeemable in these nuggets.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Extra Firm Tofu</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Paprika, Black Pepper, Salt, (I also like to add harissa for fun). Measure these with you heart</li>
        <li>Cornstarch</li>
        <li>Sot Sauce</li>
        <li>Sesame Oil. If you aren't sure what brand to get I recommend subtlely following the grannies at your local asian grocer and see which bottle they go for.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium size bowl place the pressed and cubed tofu. Add in liquid aminos and toss to coat. Add in all of the other seasoning ingredients including the oil and toss to thoroughly combine.</li>
        <li>Place in your air fryer in a single row, so that all the tofu has a little bit of space around each piece. Set your air fryer to 400Â°F. Cook for 10 minutes, shaking the basket after 5 minutes, then continuing to cook. </li>
        <li>Remove after tofu is cooked. Allow to cool for a few minutes then serve. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>    
    </ul>
