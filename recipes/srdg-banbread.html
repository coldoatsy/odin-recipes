    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A tasty and moist banana bread that makes use of some of your discard after feeding you starter.</p>
    <p>This version of banana bread does not last long in my house.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="libb">
        <li>250 g Bananas approx. 3 medium overripe bananas</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>5 g Vanilla Extract 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>80 g Butter Melted (can be salted or unsalted)</li>
        <li>100 g Sourdough Starter Discard</li>
        <li>200 g All Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>12 g Baking Powder 2 teaspoons</li>
        <li>100 g Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>50 g White Sugar optional</li>
        <li>pinch Salt</li>
        <li>20 g Golden Syrup for brushing on after baking</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="libb">
        <li>Preheat oven to 180C/350F.</li>
        <li>Mash the overripe bananas with the back of a fork until they are fairly smooth (a few lumps is fine).</li>
        <li>Now lightly beat the egg and vanilla together and add that to the mashed bananas. Use your fork to lightly mix the egg mix through.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, melt the butter on a low heat and then add that the egg and banana mixture.</li>
        <li>Now add the sourdough starter to the egg mixture and mix throughly.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix all dry ingredients together and ensure that everything is mixed thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Now add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir until just combined.</li>
        <li>Pour mixture into a buttered loaf tin.</li>
        <li>Bake at 180C/350F for around 1 hour. Baking time will depend on the size of your tin and your oven.</li>
        <li>The banana bread is cooked when a skewer is inserted and comes out clean.</li>
        <li>When you take the banana bread out of the oven, brush the top with golden syrup for a lovely shiny, sweet glaze.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool for 30 minutes before removing from the tin. (Very Important! it <em>Will</em> fall apart if you take it out before allowing it to cool in the tin)</li>
    </ol>
